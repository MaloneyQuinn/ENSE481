PWM Calculations

CLK = 72MHz, PSC = 71

new frequency = 72MHZ / (71 + 1) = 1MHz
period = 1 / 1MHZ = 0.001ms

To for a waveform with a 20ms period(50Hz)
ARR = 20ms / 0.001ms = 20000

Servo operating range is 600us to 2400us
CCRxMin = 600   -> 3% duty cycle
CCRxMax = 2400  -> 12% duty cycle
